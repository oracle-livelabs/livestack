/*
 * load_demand_forecasts.sql
 * Seed data for DEMAND_FORECASTS table
 *
 * WHY THIS WAS EMPTY:
 * demand_forecasts was defined in 01_tables.sql (schema creation) but no
 * corresponding INSERT script was ever written and it was never included
 * in load_all_data.sql. The table is central to the "Product Demand Forecasting"
 * demo story in the README ("See AI-predicted customer demands before they hit,
 * with explainable reasoning").
 *
 * This script generates 30-day rolling forecasts for critical sporting goods products across
 * major regions. The social_factor column stores AI-detected market and operations
 * signal momentum from the source graph. The explanation column stores
 * JSON-formatted reasoning (as Oracle JSON / CLOB) — the foundation for
 * explainable AI demand predictions.
 *
 * model_version = 'signal_aware_v2' represents Oracle ML pipeline:
 *   Signal-source graph signals -> Vector semantic matching -> Time-series demand
 *
 * Run AFTER: load_products.sql (needs product_id references)
 * Run AFTER: load_social_posts.sql (signal context)
